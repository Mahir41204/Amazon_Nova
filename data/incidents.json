The anomaly score of 0.87 exceeded the baseline threshold by 3.2 standard deviations. Confidence was further reinforced by similarity to 2 prior incidents in the vector memory store (avg similarity: 0.84), both confirmed brute-force attacks.

Confidence was further reinforced by similarity to 2 prior incidents in the vector memory store (avg similarity: 0.84), both confirmed brute-force attacks.
