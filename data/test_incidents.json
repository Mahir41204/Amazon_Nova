The classification was driven by the detection of 47 failed SSH login attempts from a single source IP within a 3-minute window \u2014 a pattern consistent with automated credential-stuffing tools. The anomaly score of 0.87 exceeded the baseline threshold by 3.2 standard deviations. Confidence was further reinforced by similarity to 2 prior incidents in the vector memory store (avg similarity: 0.84), both confirmed brute-force attacks. The immediate privilege escalation to root 12 seconds post-breach elevated the severity from 'high' to 'critical', triggering automated containment via Nova Act.",
